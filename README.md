# FastaiV2Course 2020
> Various projects following machine learning and deep learning courses. Mostly centered around fastai and python with a few introductions to swift, tensorflow and vanilla pytorch.


## Install

There is no need to install this as a library, instead clone the repo and install the dependencies to follow along. Conda is recommended but not necessary, if you like you can just install the dependencies in environment.yml using pip.

    git clone https://github.com/hoftherose/FastaiV2Course.git
    cd FastaiV2Course
    conda env create -f environment.yml

## How to use

This is made to be a course overview using the newer deep learning tools found in pytorch v1, tensorflow v2, fastaiv2 and swift for tensorflow. This is not a tutorial for deep learning, but could be used as such. If you want to follow along with the examples presented here you it would be best to do so with the courses. Links to the corresponding course will be below.
